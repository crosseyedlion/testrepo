"",""
"Notes","1. Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 population, standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population. Monthly rates are adjusted to allow for comparisons with annual rates. For more information, see [Section 10: Measuring the data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/may2021#measuring-the-data). 
2. Figures for 2020 and 2021 are based on provisional mortality data and projected populations. 
3. Figures exclude deaths of non-residents. 
4. The five-year average has been provided for 2015 to 2019 (rather than 2016 to 2020) because of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on deaths registered in 2020. The average for 2015 to 2019 provides a comparison of the number of deaths expected per month in a usual (non-pandemic) year."
